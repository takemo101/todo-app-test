--- Iteration 1 ---
Docstrings are unnecessary here - the function names `multiply` and `divide` are self-explanatory, and the type signatures make parameters clear. Removing them.
Done.

**Summary:**
- Created `src/math.ts` with `multiply` and `divide` functions (divide throws on zero division)
- Created `src/math.test.ts` with 7 tests covering:
  - multiply: positive numbers, negative numbers, zero
  - divide: positive numbers, negative numbers, decimal results, zero division error
- All 17 tests pass (10 existing + 7 new)
- No TypeScript errors
